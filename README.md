# Starter Kit

This project illustrates using open data with both Kineviz and Senzing.

  1. load OpenSanctions + OpenOwnership into Sz
  2. configure to run entity resolution (ER) in Sz
  3. export ER results as a NetworkX graph, serialized to JSON
  4. load the source data records and ER results into Kv
  5. video to illustrate graph (3D spin)
  6. drill-down into a specific case to explore
  7. illustrate the "before and after" contrast of this case with or without ER
